# First-weeks-of-studying-bash-
#my very first bash scripts

1)The BCproject : a Basic Calculator Written in BASH

2)Tiny buggy script., but not so bad after a few weeks of BASH.
project: (the script)
-this script takes the file " FILE_RECORD" as an external argument and treats it as a "data base" ,it inserts, deletes and does more.
-the file is optimized with "FileRecord.log" to be the log file. (has to be in the same directory of the script)
